Hello! My name is Blake Bollman

Recently I have dove into a web development program at Galvanize Boulder and have been intensely learning 8-13 hours a day.  

I have been learning anything and everything about HTML5 JavaScript Github CSS and anything Front End for the next few weeks.  

The last time I did something that scared me I jumped out of a plane.  

Something I know that most people don't:  The key to a solid golf shot is to not think about what you are doing.  use your muscle memory form past practice to guide you and relax.  your shot will be better than expected! always think positive!
